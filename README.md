# GooglePlusPlus User Mute

## General Information
The `googleplusplus_user_mute` userscript / extension for Google+ (aka Google Plus aka G+) mutes all posts by specific users. Click _MUTE USER_ link next to the Public/Limited status. Once muted, a placeholder for each post appears with _{User Name} UNMUTE_, which if clicked will stop muting that particular user.

Shared posts where the originator is muted also get muted and in the placeholder appears: (MUTED SHARE â€“ SEE ORIGINAL POSTER TO UNMUTE). Clicking _SEE ORIGINAL POSTER TO UNMUTE_ takes you to the originator's profile where you can UNMUTE them.


So far, this userscript / extension was tested on Google Chrome 12 and Firefox 5 with [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) ([download](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748/)) and should also work in Safari with the plugin [NinjaKit](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/os0x/20100612/1276330696) ([download](http://ss-o.net/safari/extension/NinjaKit.safariextz)).

Feedback is welcome.
